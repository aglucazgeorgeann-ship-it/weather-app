WeatherPro - World-Class Weather App
Introduction
The WeatherPro is a modern and visually stunning web application designed to provide quick and engaging weather information. It focuses on delivering a user-friendly and aesthetic experience, featuring an elegant glassmorphism UI and dynamic, animated backgrounds.

This app is built purely with foundational web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to showcase strong front-end development and design capabilities, particularly in creating immersive user interfaces.

Features
City Search: Users can easily search for weather information by city name.

Current Weather Details: Displays essential current weather conditions, including temperature, weather description, wind speed, humidity, visibility, and "feels like" temperature.

3-Day Forecast: Provides a simplified, quick glance at the weather forecast for the next three days.

Glassmorphism User Interface: A contemporary design trend featuring transparent, frosted-glass-like elements for a sleek and modern look.

Dynamic Background Animation: A smooth and continuously shifting gradient background animation that adds visual dynamism and flair.

Floating Particles Effect: Subtle, randomly generated particles float across the screen, enhancing the depth and interactive feel of the background.

Responsive Design: The layout gracefully adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing and interaction experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Loading Spinner: A visual indicator is displayed while weather data is being "fetched" (simulated loading).

Date & Time Display: Automatically updates and shows the current date and time.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Provides the structural foundation and content of the web page.

CSS3: Utilized for styling, layout management, responsive adaptations, and intricate animations (including the glassmorphism effects, gradient shifts, and particle movements).

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Powers the app's interactivity, handles user input, simulates data fetching, updates the UI dynamically, and generates the background particle effects.

Google Fonts (Inter): Ensures a modern and highly readable typography throughout the application.

How to Run Locally
To get the WeatherPro app up and running on your local machine, simply follow these steps:

Download or Clone the Repository:
If you have the project files, ensure they are in a local folder. If it's a Git repository, you can clone it:

git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE]
cd weather-pro-app

Open the index.html File:
Navigate to the project folder on your computer. Double-click the index.html file, or drag and drop it into your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

That's it! No server or complex dependencies are needed, as this is a client-side only application.

How to Use
Enter a City Name: Type a city name (e.g., "Manila", "Tokyo", "New York", "London", "Paris") into the input field labeled "Enter city name...".

Search: Click the "üîç" (Search) button or press the Enter key on your keyboard.

View Weather: The app will simulate fetching weather data for the entered city and update the display with current conditions and a 3-day forecast.

Note: This version of the app uses sample, hardcoded data for a few cities. For any other city, it will generate random data. It is currently not connected to a live Weather API.

Future Enhancements
Real Weather API Integration: Connect the app to an actual weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, AccuWeather) to fetch real-time and accurate weather data for any global city.

Dynamic Weather Icons/Backgrounds: Implement logic to change the weather icon and background gradient/animation based on actual weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy, stormy).

Unit Conversion: Add options to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Geolocation: Implement features to automatically detect the user's current location and display local weather.

More Detailed Forecast: Expand the forecast section to include hourly predictions, sunrise/sunset times, UV index, and other relevant metrics.

Improved Error Handling: Provide more user-friendly feedback for invalid city names or network issues.
